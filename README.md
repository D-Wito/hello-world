# hello-world
This is my public repository. My name is Daniel Witoslawski. Some people call me Wito (pronounced Widow). I graduated UNLV with a Bachelor's Degree in Biology, but I was always interested in computers and technology. Through college, I taught myself some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I even started a minor (that I unfortunately dropped) and took 2 semesters of C++. I regret not just dropping the minor, but not switching majors entirely. CS class was one of the only times I enjoyed homework. So, here we are. I am trying to transition into a tech job, and I am considering going back to school for a CS degree.
